# GOFPatterns

Gang of Four Design Patterns

## Creational

- **Abstract factory pattern**: groups object factories with common theme
- **Builder pattern**: builds complex objects by separating construction and representation
- **Factory method pattern**: creates objects without which exact class to create
- **Prototype pattern**: creates objects by cloning an existing object
- **Singleton pattern**: restricts object creation for a class to only one instance

## Structural

- **Adapter**: makes classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping the interface around existing interfaces
- **Bridge**: decouples an abstraction from its implementation
- **Composite**: composes similar objects together so that it can be treated as one object
- **Decorator**: dynamically adds behavior in existing methods of an object
- **Facade**: simplifies inferface to big code
- **Flyweight**: reduces cost of creating and manipulating large code
- **Proxy**: provides a placeholder for another object to control access, reduce cost and complexity


## Behavioral

- **Chain of responsibility**
- **Command**
- **Interpreter**
- **Iterato**
- **Mediator**
- **Momento**
- **Observer**
- **State**
- **Strategy**
- **Template method**
- **Visitor**

## Other (Not included in origina GOF but relevant to me)

- **Model-View-Controller**
- **Entity-Component-System**
